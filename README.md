> My experiment for Research Project.

## Introduction

This experiment aims to compare [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) in a range of scenarios.

The scenarios include the following:

- File I/O.
- Fibonacci (1 and 2 threads).
- Reading and manipulating JSON.
- Interfacing with databases (MySQL and MongoDB).

The experiment measures code length, runtime, and memory usage.

## Usage
